1. Training

   TODO:
   - "convnet_features" matlab API that takes a pile of small images (pos_warped or neg_warped), stitches them, and feeds them into Caffe.
   - tweak training code to call "caffe('convnet_features', ...)" on the whole batch of warped examples.
   - ask Ross how he handles padding in R-CNN. (zero-padding, or other values in padding?)


2. Pyramids

   TODO:
   - enable "convnet_featpyramid" to accept DPM model that contains padx, pady. 
        complain if sbin != 16; 
        assert that padx==pady;
   - add option to keep or remove padding when unstitching.
   - replace featpyramid with convnet_featpyramid
